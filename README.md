## Model Fine-Tuning Process

We employed a rigorous process to fine-tune our model for optimal performance:

1. **Data Collection**: We carefully selected 50 diverse startup ideas from around the world to create a high-quality training dataset.

2. **Initial Analysis**: Multiple high-parameter language models were used to generate initial analyses of these startup ideas.

3. **Human-in-the-Loop Refinement**: Human reviewers evaluated and refined the model outputs, ensuring accuracy and relevance.

4. **Iterative Improvement**: We made continuous tweaks to the process based on human feedback to generate high-quality samples.

5. **Model Selection**: After extensive testing, we chose open-mistral-7b as our base model due to its performance and efficiency.

6. **Fine-Tuning**: The open-mistral-7b model was fine-tuned for 30 steps with a learning rate of 10^-4.

7. **Validation**: Rigorous testing was conducted to ensure the fine-tuned model met our high standards for startup idea analysis.
